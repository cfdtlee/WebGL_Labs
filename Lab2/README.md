# Lab2

## Describes how to use your program

- Open Lab2.html via Chrome, (you have to open Lab2.html in a server, because it reads files. If there is problem runing Lab2, go to http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~lishuan/5542/Lab2/lab2.html to see a counterpart in my CSE webpage).
- The scene consists of stars and helicopter, they can be move and rotate individually.
- Press w, s, a, d and r(otate) keys to move stars, or use up, down, left, right key and i(n), o(ut) key to change the speed of the helicopter.

## States which bonus tasks you attempted
- Auto Animation: check "Auto Mode" to see auto animation
- Phisical rules: when you move helicopter it flies like a real helicopter. It tilts and accelerate its screws to fly. The faste it flies, the bigger angle it has, the faster its screws rotate.
- Hidden game: if you park helicopter on the bottom border, you win.
- Use multiple stars to decorate the scene.
- Use texture to beautify objects.

## Lists which browser/OS you developed your code on (just in case)
